## Cutting releases in osm-azure

This guide details how to cut releases for the osm-arc chart in this repository. 

Once the chart version in the main branch has been updated to the most recent version and lists the appropriate upstream version as a dependency, switch back to 'main' and click the 'Release' tab on the right side of the page. Then click "draft a new release." 

The tag version should follow this format: v<version-no>. For example, if you are cutting a release 0.6.2, the tag should be v0.6.2. 

The release title should follow this format: release-v<version-no>. For example, if you are cutting a release for 0.6.2, the release title should be release-v0.6.2. 

Once you have entered the tag version and release title, click "Publish Release."
